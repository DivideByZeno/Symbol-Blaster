# Symbol-Blaster
Game with modern user interface (UI) inspired by retro arcade cabinets. Written in C# using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Prototyped in Adobe XD.

# Summary
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Inspired by retro arcade game mechanics and visuals, Symbol Blaster is an old-school, 2-D shooter game with modern twists. Whereas many games from the "Golden Age" of arcade systems featured static, pre-defined game object geometries, Symbol Blaster allows the player to customize the geometries and colors of all major game objects ("Sprites") in real-time. Changing the geometry of a Sprite in Symbol Blaster also changes that Sprite's underlying hit-test geometry, resulting in subtle game-play variations based on the sizes and shapes of customized Sprites.

# How It Works
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Symbol Blaster features a Model-View-ViewModel (M-V-VM) architecture to implement the UI and game world. A MainViewModel governs the state and behavior of the UI, while a GameViewModel governs the state and behavior of the game. The eXtensible Application Markup Language (XAML) code that defines the "skeleton" of the UI incorporates the ViewModel logic through various data-bindings that enable the user to influence application state. Since the UI navigation topology is fixed at compile time, navigation is handled by a simple TabControl populated with TabItems that contain collapsible sections. Both the front-end XAML and the back-end ViewModel components are modular in order to foster development efficiency and easier maintenance. NUnit is the unit testing framework used to conduct automated testing of the application.
